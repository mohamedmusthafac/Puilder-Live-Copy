Copy and Paste elements between sites via the Clipboard

== Description ==

Please welcome the ultimate evolution of the classical Copy/Paste operation! 
Clipboard Cross-Domain Copy-Paste allows you to copy any element from Sections to Cols, Widgets, and whole Pages or just their style and paste them to other domains. 
What is more, you can store the Copied JSON for a later Paste and also share it with your friends!
